## Add your .env files

You will need to create two .env files for this application at the root level: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). For security reasons please double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
